# NetCoreWorkerService
This project describes how to create. NET Core 3.1 version of Windows Service.

Upgrade from.net Framework to. NET Core, creating Windows Services in a completely different way. Also, MSDN documentation only describes how to use the latest. NET 6 to create Windows Service. Many actual projects are still stuck in VS 2019 and not available. NET 6. So I created the.net Core 3.1 version of Windows Service.
